# Leads-Tab
** The save tab feature will work when used as an extension only. ** 


This project is, in itself, meant to be a Google Chrome web browser extension. It allows you to track leads (websites) whether you copy-paste the link or simply add the entire current tab. Upon pressing the add button, you will be able to see all your leads in an unordered list. Whenever you save or delete your leads, they are added to and deleted from your local storage.

I learned how to do this thanks to FreeCodeCamp.
